# SOC Alert Triage Engine

SOC Alert Triage Engine is a log-based security analysis project that parses multi-source security logs, detects suspicious activity with YAML-based rules, suppresses known false positives, deduplicates repeated alerts, correlates alerts into incidents, reconstructs attack timelines, and generates analyst-friendly incident reports.

This project is not a simple log viewer or SIEM dashboard. It focuses on reducing analyst workload by converting noisy raw alerts into incident-level findings.

## Key Features

- Nginx `access.log` parsing
- Linux `auth.log` parsing
- YAML-based detection rules
- SQL Injection, XSS, and Path Traversal detection
- SSH failed/successful login detection
- Allowlist-based false positive suppression
- Alert deduplication by source IP and rule ID
- Incident correlation by source IP
- Attack timeline reconstruction
- Markdown incident report generation

## Detection Rules

Detection rules are written in a simplified Sigma-like YAML format.

```yaml
id: WEB-SQLI-001
title: SQL Injection Attempt
source: nginx
severity: high
mitre:
  - T1190
conditions:
  url_contains:
    - "' OR '1'='1"
    - "UNION SELECT"
    - "sleep("
    - "benchmark("
  user_agent_contains:
    - "sqlmap"
dedup:
  key:
    - src_ip
    - rule_id
  window_minutes: 10
```

## Sample Scenario

The included sample logs simulate the following activity from `45.12.33.10`:

1. Path traversal attempt
2. SQL Injection attempts
3. XSS attempt
4. SSH brute force attempts
5. SSH successful login after repeated failures

A known administrator login from `203.0.113.77` is suppressed by the allowlist.

## Sample Result

```text
[+] Parsed nginx events: 7
[+] Parsed auth events: 6
[+] Parsed total events: 13
[+] Loaded rules: 5
[+] Generated raw alerts: 11
[+] Suppressed alerts: 1
[+] Deduped alerts: 5
[+] Alert reduction rate: 54.55%
[+] Generated incidents: 1
```

The engine reduced noisy raw alerts into one correlated critical incident.

## Generated Incident Timeline

```text
INC-000001 45.12.33.10 CRITICAL alerts=5 rules=5
    - Path Traversal Attempt
    - SQL Injection Attempt
    - Cross-Site Scripting Attempt
    - SSH Failed Login
    - SSH Successful Login
```

## Current Detection Coverage

| Category | Rule ID | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Web Attack | WEB-SQLI-001 | SQL Injection attempt |
| Web Attack | WEB-XSS-001 | Cross-Site Scripting attempt |
| Web Attack | WEB-PATH-001 | Path Traversal attempt |
| SSH/Auth | SSH-FAIL-001 | SSH failed login |
| SSH/Auth | SSH-SUCCESS-001 | SSH successful login |

## Security Notes

This project uses synthetic sample logs for safe local testing.

It does not perform scanning, exploitation, brute force, or any offensive action against real systems.

## Roadmap

- Add rule-level dedup window support
- Add SSH brute force threshold rule
- Add Streamlit dashboard
- Add test cases for parsers, rules, dedup, and suppression
- Add Suricata EVE JSON parser
- Add MITRE ATT&CK tactic mapping
- Add severity scoring based on event sequence
